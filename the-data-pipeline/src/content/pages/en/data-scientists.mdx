Data Scientists are responsible for the furniture of a specific type of insights: statistical predictions obtained using artificial intelligence techniques.

Their role is to:

* Understand the phenomenon they are trying to predict – especially the variables that affect the outcome (e.g., the retention of a customer for the next 6 months);
* Employ the best statistical techniques to predict the outcome and create a prediction system. This prediction system is then used to automate decision making on a large scale using data from the gold layer.

Making statistical predictions is complex and costly, so it only makes sense when what is at stake is worth it and decisions must be made on a large scale (e.g., for millions of users). Hence, not all organizations have the need for Data Science.
