Data Analysts:

* Discuss with end users looking for insights to understand their needs and translate them into a rigorous analysis.
* They draw data from the gold layer and carry out manipulations specific to the question they are answering.
* Finally, they communicate the insights they obtain, usually via dashboards or ad-hoc reports & presentations.

With Data Scientists, they are responsible for one of the last "conduits" of the Data Pipeline – the communication of actionable insights that bring value to the organization. Most commonly, they bring value by reducing uncertainty for decision-makers.

Unlike Data Engineers, Analytics Engineers, and Data Scientists, their work is often situational: their analyses are frequently one-offs that follow the current needs of the organization.
